Currently, only US market data is supported.

Left click to scroll/zoom. Right click to reopen settings after initial setup.

## Q & A

### How do I trade?

This is a pre-alpha release of the software, trading is not yet possible, but will be added eventually.

I'm self-employed. I'd love to work full time on this project, but I need to pay my bills. If you'd like to speed up development, please sponsor this project using the links above.

### How about more indicators?

More indicators will be added eventually. Again, please sponsor this project to support further development.

### Does maystocks also support crypto data/trading?

Not yet, but I plan to add support. Please bear with me - any kind of encouragement is welcome :-)

### Could you please add support for a specific broker/api provider?

Please suggest additional brokers on the community discord.

If you would like commercially sponsor this project, please contact me through [maystocks.net](https://www.maystocks.net/).
